# Spam Detector using machine learning

This project is an SMS spam detection system developed as an academic project in April 2024. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to accurately distinguish between legitimate texts and spam.

Technologies Used :

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas


Project Overview :

The objective of this project is to enhance the security and reliability of mobile messaging by accurately detecting spam messages. The system was trained using a database of over 5000 SMS messages, employing various classifiers to achieve the best results.

Methodology :

A dataset of 5000+ SMS messages was used for training and testing the models.
NLP and Machine Learning Libraries
NLTK: Used for text processing and feature extraction.
Scikit-learn: Used for implementing machine learning models.

Classifiers Used : 

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree
Support Vector Classifier
Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
Random Forest

Results :

Among the various classifiers, the Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 97.87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.

Significance :

This project contributes to a safer and more efficient mobile communication system by accurately detecting and filtering spam messages, thereby enhancing the overall security and reliability of mobile messaging.
